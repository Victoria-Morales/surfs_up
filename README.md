# Surf's Up - Weather Analysis of Oahu

## Overview 
#### The purpose of this project is to provide a weather analysis to the client, W. Avy.  Providing detailed temperature data for both the months of June and December will help the client determine if their proposed Surf/Ice Cream Shop is a sustainable business year round on the island of Oahu.
 

## Results

* Average temperature is less than four degrees higher in June than December
	* June's average temperature is 74.94
	* December's average temperature is 71.04

* Maximum temperature are very close, only about two degree difference between June and December
	* June's max temperature is 85
	* December's max temperature is 83

* Minimum temperatures have the biggest difference when comparing June and December
	* Junes' minimum temperature is 64
	* December's minimum temperature is 56

## Summary
#### The temperature statistics of Oahu for June and December provide a pretty convincing argument to start the surf and ice cream shop.  There is a relatively small variance in the average temperatures between June and December, which would tend to be at the extremes of the weather, thus a surf and ice cream shop would be a viable business venture. 

#### One additional query for the June and December data that we could run is the station id data to ensure that we are gathering enough data from various stations accross the island and not just certain locations.  It is imporatant to get a full picture of temperatures on the island, and specifically the are that W. Avy is planning to open the surf and ice cream shop.

#### The second additional query that could be run is the precipitation data for June and December. It would be imporatant to use this data in conjunction with the temperature data to have a full picture of the conditions in Oahu at these two points in the year.

#### In my opinion, it would be useful to provide two more data points (March and September), to ensure that there are not wild temperature swings that we could be missing.  In fact, a quick look at the statistics for March and September, show them to be on the more extreme sides than June and December.  March has a lower average temp than December and September has a higher average temperature than June.  But these temperatures still are moderate enough to provide a positive outlook for the surf and ice cream shop.
